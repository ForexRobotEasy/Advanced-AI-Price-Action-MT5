## Description

The Advanced AI Price Action MT5 expert advisor is an automated trading system that uses advanced artificial intelligence algorithms to analyze price action and make trading decisions. It scans and trades multiple currency pairs, with customizable settings for maximum pairs to scan and trade, and risk percentage per trade.

The expert advisor is designed to be attached to the EURUSD - M5 chart. It implements smart entry/exit algorithms to determine safe entry points for trades. The stop loss level is calculated based on the market's stop level, assuming it is twice the stop level. The expert advisor also has the option to enable machine learning to improve decision-making after each trade.

## Input Parameters

- MaxPairs: Maximum number of pairs to scan and trade
- RiskPercentage: Risk percentage per trade

## Global Variables

- g_magicNumber: Magic number for trade identification
- g_accountBalance: Account balance
- g_stopLossLevel: Stop loss level
- g_isLearningEnabled: Flag to indicate if machine learning is enabled

## Functions

- OnInit(): Expert initialization function.
- OnDeinit(): Expert deinitialization function.
- OnTick(): Expert tick function.

## How it Works

1. The expert advisor is initialized by setting the magic number, getting the account balance, calculating the stop loss level, and enabling machine learning.
2. The expert advisor continuously checks if it is attached to the EURUSD - M5 chart.
3. It verifies if there are enough pairs to scan and trade.
4. It loops through all the pairs and retrieves the current price data.
5. It applies smart entry/exit algorithms to determine if it is safe to enter a trade.
6. If a safe entry is detected, a buy trade is performed with the calculated stop loss and take profit levels.
7. If the trade is executed successfully and machine learning is enabled, data is learned and analyzed after the trade.
8. The expert advisor also includes a function to back-test the strategy from 2008 to 2022 using real ticks.
9. The expert advisor starts trading and continuously calls the OnTick() function to scan for potential trades.
